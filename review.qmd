# Major concepts from first class:

## simulating data

we simulate so we can compare the linear regression values from our data with random simulated data to determine the likelihood of our data

## sampling distribution

sampling distribution is the distribution of parameter estimates across multiple samples of data

The correct parameters will be in the middle of the histogram and as well as the points when the estimate of intercept is plotted against estimate of slope.

## sampling error

standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution to find the true standard error you can increase the number of simulations

## p-value

is how probable that null hypothesis (slope is 0) is true or at least as extreme p values are helpful if we are skeptical about the conclusion

## intercept

the average value of Y when all predictors are set equal to 0

## slope

predicted change in Y per unit increase in X

# Questions:

In class perry said "simulating data allows us to ask how methods perform across a distribution of data" - what does this mean? arent we looking at how our data perform across a distribution?

how do you know when to use linear regressions? - (also when looking at just two variables?) residuals normally distributed
