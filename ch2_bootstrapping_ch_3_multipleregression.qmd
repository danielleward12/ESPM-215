assumptions need to met for the linear regression
- linear relationship
- independence of residuals
- homoskedastic
- normally distributed residuals

least squares regression is used to estimate parameters

estimation vs inference are two important, but different concepts

estimation is how we'll get estimates of the parameters of the model
(parametric statistics vs. non parametric statistics)

vs. inference
saying what we believe about hypotheses that relate to the parameters
(things related to probability and uncertainty)
